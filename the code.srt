1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
بذارید یه مقایسه بکنم، بین نرم‌افزارها و دستورات آشپزی

2
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,501
نرم‌افزار خیلی شبیه به دستور پخته. هر دوشون یک لیست از مراحل هستند که باید انجام بشن

3
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:34,502
همراه با قوانینی که مشخص می‌کنن این مراحل چه زمانی درست انجام شدن، یا نیاز به اصلاح دارن

4
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:39,510
و در نهایت به یک نتیجه مشخص ختم میشن.

5
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,501
اگه اهل آشپزی باشید، احتمالا بین دوستان‌تون دستورات پخت رد و بدل می‌کنید

6
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,502
و احتمالا اون‌ها رو تغییر هم می‌دید.

7
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:53,503
اگر از تغییرات خوشتون اومد، و همراه دوستان‌تون از غذای جدید لذت بردید

8
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,504
ممکنه که نسخه تغییر یافته دستور پخت رو به دوستان‌تون هم بدید.

9
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:02,505
حالا دنیایی رو تصور کنید که توش نمی‌تونید دستور پخت رو تغییر بدید

10
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:08,506
چون یک نفر تلاش کرده که این رو غیر ممکن کنه.

11
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:14,507
و تصور کنید که اگر دستور پخت رو به اشتراک بگذارید، دزد خطاب می‌شید

12
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,508
و تلاش می‌کنند برای سال‌ها زندانی‌تون بکنند.

13
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,500
من از کلمه «هکر» در مفهوم درست و اصیلش استفاده می‌کنم

14
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:57,505
برای توصیف شخصی که با شور و شوق هنری برنامه‌نویسی کامپیوتر رو دنبال می‌کنه

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,500
و همچنین شخصی که بخشی از فرهنگ هکرهاست، یا با این فرهنگ شناخته میشه

16
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:09,505
مثل اشخاصی که اینترنت، لینوکس و شبکه جهانی وب رو ساختن.

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,500
من فکر می‌کنم شما باید یک هکر باشید تا متوجه این طرز فکر خاص بشید

18
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:34,505
که در برابر این ایده که کد منبع سیستم‌عامل باید مخفی بمونه شورش می‌کنه.

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,500
این نگرش متن باز به راحتی با اقتصاد بازار آزاد کنار نیومد.

20
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:49,505
همچنین یک تهدید برای مفاهیم سنتی کپی‌رایت و انحصار فکری است.

21
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
کمپانی‌هایی مثل مایکروسافت که تجارت‌شون بر اساس کد بسته شکل گرفته

22
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:57,505
به‌طور فعال نرم‌افزار آزاد رو به شکل

23
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:01,506
یک هیولایی که مک‌کارتی‌گری (ویکی‌پدیا: جوزف مک کارتی) می‌کنه به تصویر می‌کشن.

24
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
همه این‌ها یکی از بزرگ‌ترین موفقیت‌های دهه ۱۹۹۰ رو رقم زد

25
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:12,505
که توسط رهبر با استعداد و گرانقدر این جامعه صورت خارجی گرفت

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
او دانه‌ای برای یک نهضت کاشت که شاخه‌های اون به گسترش‌شون ادامه میدن.

27
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
لینوس توروالدز یک سیستم کامپیوتری ساخت

28
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,505
که کل صنعت رو به شگفتی فرو برد.

29
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
لینوکس، یک سیستم عامل که الان روی ۸ میلیون کامپیوتر در دنیا اجرا میشه.

30
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:33,505
مجله وایرد: اون یک جادوگره که با واینامویمن برابری می‌کنه

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
و سیستم‌عامل اون، لینوکس، بزرگ‌ترین شاهکار اینترنت هست.

32
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:42,505
تصمیم توروالدز مبنی بر انتشار رایگان لینوکس

33
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
و منتشر کردن کد منبع لینوکس، از توروالدز یک شخصیت ستودنی ساخت.

34
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:50,505
لینوس تورالدز، نابغه کامپیوتری که رویاش مغلوب کردن مایکروسافت

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
و در واقع بیل گیتس هست. چطور پیش میره؟

36
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:56,505
افرادی هستند که میگن لینوس توروالدز دست پیدا کرده به یک

37
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
معجزه.

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
مورچه‌های کارگر به‌طور ثابت با یکدیگر به‌وسیله مودم در ارتباط هستند

39
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:14,505
کد رو منتشر می‌کنند، مشتاق بازخورد تغییرات هستند

40
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
برای ساختن بهترین سیستم‌عامل ممکن در دنیا.

41
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
سن ژوزه، کالیفرنیا

42
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
من نمی‌خوام هیچکس دیگه‌ای همین مسیر که من رفتم رو دوباره طی کنه

43
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:40,505
برای پیدا کردن چیزی مثل لینوکس. شاید یک دانشجوی کامپیوتر دیگه

44
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
سیستم‌عامل خودش رو لازم داشته باشه و اون مجبور نیست از اول شروع کنه.

45
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:51,505
این یک جنگ علیه آسیاب‌های بادی نبود.
این، دون کیشوت در برابر دنیا نبود

46
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
در تلاش برای ساختن یک مکان بهتر.

47
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
بیا، بیا. غذا می‌خوای؟

48
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
من بیشتر ترجیح میدم با دیگران به‌وسیله ایمیل کار کنم تا رو در رو.

49
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:16,505
در غیر این‌صورت شما وارد همه این بحث‌ها و جزئیات مهمل میشید.

50
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,500
روی ایمیل، شما باید قبل از ارسال یک پاسخ کمی فکر کنید.

51
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
فقط به‌خاطر این‌که ما توی یک مکان نیستیم، معنی‌ش این نیست که

52
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:47,505
ما درکنار هم یک اجتماع نیستیم. این مثل یک دفتر کار مشترک خیلی خیلی بزرگه.

53
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
ما حتی بحث‌هامون رو هم در اینترنت انجام می‌دیم.

54
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:58,505
این یک پروژه عظیمه. من هیچ پروژه نرم‌افزاری نمی‌شناسم

55
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,500
که افراد خیلی زیادی از مکان‌های مختلف روش کار کرده باشند

56
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:08,505
که همه این‌ها رو کنار هم قرار بدن.

57
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,509
مهم‌ترین خلاقیت جامعه لینوکس، کد منبع نیست

58
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
بلکه اجتماعی است که حول آن شکل گرفته.

59
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
لینوکس چیه...؟ بذارید این‌طوری بگم...

60
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:31,505
همه کامپیوترها متفاوت هستن، همه فلاپی‌خوان‌ها متفاوت هستند

61
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,500
همه هارد دیسک ها متفاوت هستند، همه پردازشگرهای گرافیکی متفاوت هستند...

62
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:42,505
لینوکس اون چیزیه که می‌دونه چطور باعث بشه همه این اجزاء مختلف

63
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
وظایف ساده رو انجام بدن. مثل «فایل من رو بریز روی دیسک» یا

64
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:53,505
«این فایل رو از این فلاپی که من دارم بخون»یا «این عکس رو روی صفحه ترسیم کن».

65
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
لینوکس می‌دونه چطور با این اجزاء مختلف سخت‌افزاری صحبت کنه

66
00:06:57,505 --> 00:07:00,505
تا اون‌ها عملیات‌هایی که ما از کامپیوتر انتظار داریم رو انجام بدن.

67
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,500
وقتی که می‌گیم «لینوکس» منظور ما چیه؟
بعضی‌ها منظورشون کل سیستم‌عامله

68
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:11,505
یعنی هر چیزی که در کامپیوتر اتفاق میافته.

69
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,500
بعضی‌ها می‌گن «لینوکس»، برای اشاره به مهم‌ترین نرم‌افزار؛ هسته.

70
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
این برمی‌گرده به شخصی که این بحث رو شروع کرد. به شخصی که

71
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,505
یک جوری از اینترنت برای ساخت یک اجتماع از افراد استفاده کرد

72
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
که حس می‌کردند همه همکاری‌هاشون ارزشمنده.

73
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,500
That ability to foster cooperation
could very well be something-

74
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:46,505
-that can only come from a
person raised in a country like Finland.

75
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Helsinki, Finland

76
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,500
1969 - it seems to
have been such a good year.

77
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:13,505
The moon landing, Woodstock, the birth
of ARPANET, that led to Internet.

78
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
The first steps of UNIX, the
operating system for big computers-

79
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:27,505
-and on December 28
Linus Torvalds is born.

80
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
All children learn primarily
through playing.

81
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:39,505
For that reason I think it was
very important for Linus to enter-

82
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,500
-the computer world when computers
still were simple enough even for a-

83
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:51,505
-10-12 year old boy to understand
what was inside this machine.

84
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
In today's world there's so
many layers of information and-

85
00:08:56,505 --> 00:09:01,505
-complicated stuff between that which
is shown on the computer screen-

86
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
-and that which is inside the machine.
It's difficult for the children of today-

87
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:12,505
-to play their way to the insight
the same way Linus did.

88
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I think it was love at first
sight both for my father and for-

89
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:28,505
-Linus who together were childishly
excited, both of them, to try-

90
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
-the possibilities that VIC-20 offered.

91
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,510
The place where Linus developed
Linux is no longer-

92
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,505
-because the walls have
been torn down.

93
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Here in the corner where the couch is
is where Linus' desktop and computer,-

94
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:45,505
-that he worked on, used to be.

95
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,500
The biggest change is that he
nowadays is a stand up-guru-

96
00:09:56,505 --> 00:10:00,505
-because he is used to perform in front
of an audience and he can handle them.

97
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,500
That might not be surprising, but still
striking when compared with how-

98
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
-he actually was: relatively shy and
withdrawn, and not the one who-

99
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:18,505
-got in touch, but his friends were
the ones who kept in touch with him.

100
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Hello everybody out there using MINIX.
I'm doing a free operating system.

101
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:27,505
Just a hobby. Won't be big
and professional-

102
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
-like "GNU" for 386 and 486
AT clones.

103
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,505
This has been brewing since
April and is starting to get ready.

104
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd like any feedback on things
people like or dislike in MINIX-

105
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:44,505
-as my OS resembles it somewhat.
Any suggestions are welcome-

106
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
-but I won't promise I'll actually
implement them.

107
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,505
torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi

108
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
1991 - The Soviet Union closes down.

109
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
The Gulf War.

110
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:04,505
The British physicist
Tim Berners-Lee-

111
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,500
-releases a hypertext system,
calling it the "World Wide Web".

112
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Microsoft is well on the way
for world domination.

113
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
And on September 17
Linus Torvalds sends the first-

114
00:11:26,505 --> 00:11:32,505
-version of Linux, 0.01,
to the world, via Internet.

115
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,500
The first responses arrive
within hours.

116
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:41,505
"Linux was invented here"

117
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
"University of Helsinki"

118
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,500
We first heard whispers
in the cafeteria-

119
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,505
An operating system was being
developed and started to spread.

120
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,500
We learned to know Linus better.

121
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:18,505
His programming skills had
already been noted here.

122
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Linus based Linux on UNIX,
because of its basic ideals.

123
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:37,505
The original UNIX operating system
had been created by Ken Thompson-

124
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
-and Dennis Ritchie
at AT&T's Bell Labs in 1969.

125
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:46,505
UNIX was in the beginning a
relatively free operating system-

126
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,509
-and very popular in
the university circles.

127
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
The philosophy is
based on two notions:

128
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:58,505
Firstly, everything is a file.

129
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Secondly, when you build something
you write things that are for a single-

130
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:08,505
-purpose but to
do that purpose well.

131
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:16,509
Putting Linux on the net
was kind of natural in many ways.

132
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:22,509
There were a lot of small reasons.
Like the fact that I thought it was-

133
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,500
-a good idea to make Linux available to
others so that they could try it out-

134
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,501
-and send comments back to me.

135
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
He really had two choices.
He could make it completely free-

136
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:39,501
-or he can try and charge for it.

137
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:43,505
Linux would not exist if he
had tried to make profit out of it.

138
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Nobody would have bought it.
It would have been a dead end.

139
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,500
You haven't been here for a while.
We've already installed the third version...

140
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,500
We had difficulties to fit
Linux-stuff into one computer.

141
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:11,505
At first Linus didn't want to
release Linux for free.

142
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,500
He was thinking hard about
what kind of copyright he would use.

143
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I persuaded him to release it
under the GNU copyright.

144
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:35,505
Especially, as the compiler I
used was released under the GPL-

145
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,500
-I eventually ended
up using the GPL myself.

146
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,500
The "GNU General Public License" (GPL)
funded by the Free Software Foundation-

147
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:56,505
-in the mid 1980's says that
if you change and modify the code-

148
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
-you have to make your changes
and improvements freely available.

149
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:05,505
The GPL hinders any one person
to have a monopoly-

150
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
-over an important
piece of technology.

151
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I think the timing was good. Even
just a year earlier I don't think it-

152
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:21,505
-could've been done, and a year later
someone would've done something similar.

153
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
The Internet hadn't gotten
to the general population-

154
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:31,505
-but it was getting very strong
in university networks.

155
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'd done a mailing list program
in the "C" programming language-

156
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,505
I had to expand it
and add features.

157
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Rapidly thousands of
people were interested.

158
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:51,505
It was a surprise. The numbers
doubled in short intervals.

159
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,500
It was crazy. After 1000 people
2000, the next day 4000 people.

160
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Without Internet Linux development
would've been like chess by mail.

161
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,500
My name of choice was "FREAX".

162
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:23,505
Which was both "free", "freak"
plus the "X" that you need for UNIX.

163
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
I didn't like the name FREAX.
It wasn't very commercial...

164
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:36,505
Ari Lemmke, who actually put Linux up for
FTP, thought that it really was a bad idea.

165
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
He really hated the name. He
made the FTP site available and just-

166
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
-called it Linux because
that was the working name.

167
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,500
The name stuck, and Linux
is a much better name...

168
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
"GEEKS"

169
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,505
"NERDS"

170
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
We have an impressive
set of geeks and nerds here.

171
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:09,505
The first question from the easy category:
"How do you pronounce Linux?"

172
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Well, I pronounce Linux as "Linux".

173
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:21,505
However, the total answer
to that is if you're Linus Torvalds-

174
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
-you probably pronounce
it "Leenux". On the other hand,-

175
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,510
-if you come from the west
coast of the United States-

176
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:33,505
-you pronounce it as "Lynix". And Linus
said he doesn't care how you pronounce it-

177
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
-as long as you just use it!

178
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
It was in July of 1991-

179
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:48,505
-which was shortly after Linus had
released the 0.09 version of the kernel-

180
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,500
-that I started playing with Linux.
Heard about it on, I think, Usenet.

181
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:57,505
Downloaded it from Finland,
started playing with it-

182
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,509
-and thought it was really neat!

183
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
At that point there was very
limited trans-Atlantic Internet bandwidth-

184
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:10,505
-so it was very painful to down-
load all these packages from Finland.

185
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And so I decided: "Well, we
need to do something about this"-

186
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:21,505
-and I used my personal workstation,
"TSX-11.mit.edu"-

187
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
-and I set up a mirror archive of all the
kernel sources on my private workstation.

188
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:33,505
And that was the first US
Linux FTP site that came into existence.

189
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
The first time I got Linux was I
downloaded the floppy images for Linux-

190
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:45,505
-and in the Penn State University computer lab
I installed it on one of their machines.

191
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
They subsequently kicked me
out of the computer lab that day-

192
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,510
-but that was my
first experience with Linux.

193
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Very early in 1992 suddenly
I didn't know everybody anymore.

194
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:08,505
That it was no longer
me and a couple of friends.

195
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,500
It was me and a couple of
hundred people who I had no idea-

196
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:18,505
-where they were, what they
did with the system, and who they are.

197
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
And that was a big step.

198
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,505
University of Helsinki

199
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
The 1.0 release in 1994 was certainly
important and it meant a lot to me-

200
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,510
 خب چون کلی کار پشتش صورت گرفته

201
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:38,505
 آن حقیقتا واقعه‌ای بود برای کاربرد تجاری لینوکس.

202
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 حقیقتا استفاده تجاری قبل از لینوکس ۱.۰ سخت بود.

203
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 به کنفرانس خبری سیستم‌عامل لینوکس ۱.۰ خوش آمدید.

204
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:54,505
 چرا این هست نوعی از سیستم شبه یونیکس ساخته شده.

205
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,515
 مخصوص دانشگاه هیلسینکی ؟

206
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 چون اونجا برای pc سیستم عامل یونیکس وجود داشت.

207
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,510
 اما آنها خیلی گرون هستند.

208
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:11,505
 برای مثال داس قیمتی حدود ۲۰۰ مارک دارد.

209
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 قیمت یونیکس ۲۰۰۰۰ مارک است.

210
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:22,505
 این برای یک دانشجو خیلی زیاده تا پرداختش کند.

211
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 می‌توانید به یک فروشگاه کامپیوتر رفته و سوال کنید.

212
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:32,505
 آنها به شما شبیه کسیکه دیوانه است نگاه می‌کنند.

213
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 در واقع، این اسونه که خودتون بنویسید.

214
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 فرایند توسعه لینوکس، یگانه است.

215
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:50,505
 رتبه‌بندی ندارد ولی هرکسی آزاد است تا پیشنهاد تغیر کد بدهد.

216
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 یکشخص رهبر است و تصمیمات بزرگ می‌گیرد و بهترین ایده‌ها رو انتخاب می‌کند.

217
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:05,505
 لینوس « دیکتاتور نیک‌سرشت »

218
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 همه می‌دانند باید کسی سرپرست این کارگروهی باشد.

219
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:15,505
 و طبیعی که لینوس سرپرست باشد، چون هسته کرنل لینوکس را ساخته.

220
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 و لینوس شخصی است که خیلی خیلی رهبر خوبی است.

221
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,505
 او در واقع شخصی است بسیار فروتن.

222
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:27,515
 او حتی سعی نکرد تا اعتبار و اسمی برای کاری که کرده بدست آورد.

223
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 شما می‌خواهید داشته باشید صدها، هزاران شخصی که کار می‌کنند روی کرنل

224
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,505
 در بعضی زمان‌ها.اما نمی‌توانید از همه این اشخاص بخواهید...

225
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:42,515
 یه ضرب روش باشند. هر شخصی در اوقاتی بهش رسیدگی می‌کنه

226
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:47,515
 چون مسیری است تا برای حل شکلات باید سپری کند.

227
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:52,515
 تضاد بین شما و دیگران می‌تواند باعث وقوع یک درگیری در اون زمان بشه.

228
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 من فکری را بکار میبرم تا سلسله مراتبی باشد که من سر باشم

229
00:21:58,501 --> 00:21:59,510
 و انها افسران من 

230
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:06,505
 و من فکر نمی‌کنم راه دیگری باشد، شبیه به یک اعتماد در وب می‌ماند.

231
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,500
-where I have people I trust,
and they have people they trust.

232
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:16,505
Well, there are lots of things
that motivate developers!

233
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,500
There's artistic pride, the satisfaction that
you get from doing good craftsman-like-

234
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:25,505
-work. There's the
idealist feeling of being part of-

235
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,515
-something larger
and more important than you are.

236
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,500
There's a desire to help
the world and see that solutions happen.

237
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:37,505
In the absence of monetary rewards
most people, most of the time,-

238
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,515
-are playing for a kind of
reputation reward among their peers.

239
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
One strength of
the Linux development world-

240
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:54,505
-is that practically every software
author can be contacted directly by email.

241
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Ted Ts'o was crucial in
the spread of Linux in the United States.

242
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,500
To be fair, it's very easy to say:

243
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:08,510
"If we were in charge
we wouldn't do these things".

244
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,510
But then again, we're not getting
all these email messages saying:

245
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:13,509
"Please, let me add this new feature!"

246
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
So I don't know what I would
actually do if I were really in charge.

247
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:21,505
Dave Miller is a
maintainer who reviews changes-

248
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,515
-that developers
want to make in the kernel.

249
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,500
He is like a funnel between
the contributors and "the king" Linus.

250
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:36,505
The way that we work is...
You can talk all day about a great idea-

251
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
-or a solution
to a problem, or something that-

252
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,504
-you think is an interesting feature
for Linux to have but you gotta-

253
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,505
-show us something concrete.
Show me a piece of code that does that.

254
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Something that's tangible that I can
test myself so I can try it out and I can-

255
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:55,505
-think about what it is. Instead of just
talking abstractly about a topic all day.

256
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,505
Alan Cox, a "renaissance hacker"
is the closest collaborator to Linus.

257
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,509
His right hand man.

258
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,500
"What is Alan doing...
The other side of the story"

259
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:13,505
To me code has more in common
with i.e. poetry or some kinds of writing.

260
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
The beauty of it is in the structure,
in putting ideas across one at a time-

261
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,510
-in a clear way.

262
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:24,505
So a good piece of code you read
without comments and it's immediately-

263
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:28,510
-obvious why it's been written, how
it's elegant. So you're looking for code-

264
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:34,505
-which is both clean and elegant. But also
doesn't rely on clever programming tricks,-

265
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500
-doesn't make assumptions
which may not be true in the future.

266
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,505
Because the last thing we want to do
is having much code in the Linux kernel-

267
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,509
-which requires large
amounts of effort to keep it working.

268
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
We want code which will just
continue to work, and work forever.

269
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Having led the Linux project
for five years in Helsinki-

270
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:02,505
-Linus was recruited to
Silicon Valley, California.

271
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,500
He wanted to see the other side
of the world, the world of commerce,-

272
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:08,510
-not just the academic side.

273
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:13,505
"Edward Helmore talks to Linus Torvalds,
Silicon Valley's brightest new star"

274
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:17,510
You're quite an un-orthodox figure in
the Silicon Valley world.

275
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,504
What do they make of you there?

276
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:22,505
You're not taking their
crazy commercial part, if you like.

277
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
"TRANSMETA"

278
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Linus started to work for
a company called "Transmeta"-

279
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:29,505
A little Linux company,
but a mysterious business-

280
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,506
-that didn't want to tell,
for many years, what it was up to.

281
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
و به صورت متناقضی یک کمپانی کلوز سورس بود..

282
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:43,505
قراردادی که باعث میشد لینوس هم چنان بر روی توسعه لینوکس تمرکز داشته باشه.

283
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I have been forced into trying
to be a poster boy for Linux-

284
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:55,510
-and actually the whole
open source community at large,-

285
00:26:56,501 --> 00:27:00,501
-even though I wasn't even
the person who started open source.

286
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,500
شخص واحدی نماینده کل داستان نیست

287
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:13,505
و نقطه شروع یکتایی وجود نداره.منظورم اینه،این شبیه بامبو هستش:

288
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
شما نمی دونید چه جایی شروع شده و کجا به پایان میرسه.

289
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:20,505
فک نمیکنم این انقلاب تماما یه حرکت جدید هست.

290
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,506
مدت زمان زیادی وجود داشته در اطراف ما

291
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,500
حتی در دهه 70 میلادی،تمامی نگرش ها پیرامون یونیکس

292
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:32,505
با اینکه از دید تکنیکی متن باز و آزاد نبود

293
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,500
چون شما نیاز به تهیه لایسنس از AT&T داشتید.

294
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:42,505
Since that was not an issue
generally, you could share things freely.

295
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
When you run a program, typically
you run the executable form-

296
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:53,505
-which is a series of numbers and
nobody can make any sense of them.

297
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Only a computer can understand them.
That's what they're for.

298
00:27:57,505 --> 00:28:02,505
Those numbers are the form of a program
that the computer can understand.

299
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,500
For humans to figure out what they
mean is very hard. When we write software-

300
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:13,505
-we write it as source code, and it
looks sort of like algebra. That's the form-

301
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
-that you can
understand if you're a programmer.

302
00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:22,505
To help you figure out there
are usually lots and lots of comments-

303
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
-which are explanations that are put into
the source code to help other people-

304
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:30,504
-figure out why the
program is written the way it is.

305
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:36,505
If you get just the executables, which is
what Microsoft will probably give you-

306
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
-even if you had the freedom to make
changes you could never figure out-

307
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,504
-what changes to make.
It's too hard!

308
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,505
For the freedom to change the
software to be practical, and usable,-

309
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,506
-you gotta have the source code.

310
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,500
If you really look at the project...
As I said, Linus developed the kernel-

311
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:01,505
-but I think that the most
interesting part here is really-

312
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,509
-Richard Stallman began the movement.

313
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Have you heard
of Richard Stallman?

314
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:10,505
He wanted everyone to have the rights
to use the software, to copy the software-

315
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,500
-without breaking any laws.
To make changes, distribute them,-

316
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,510
-enhance the software. He wanted to
give people rights!

317
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,505
When he decided to overthrow corrupt
American capitalism in the IT industry-

318
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
-he quit his job
and continued coding.

319
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Join us now
and share the software

320
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:33,501
MIT,
Camebridge, Massachusetts

321
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:37,502
You'll be free,
hackers, you'll be free

322
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,505
I tend to think of things in terms
of justice, freedom and ethics.

323
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,500
I announced the idea
in November 1983-

324
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:06,505
-but it was in Januari 1984
that I quit my job at MIT-

325
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
-to start developing
a free operating system-

326
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:13,509
-to which I gave
the name "GNU".

327
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,500
This is "GNU General Public License"
and of course the kernel is under GPL...

328
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:24,509
"Free software", I should explain,
refers to freedom, not price.

329
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,500
It's unfortunate that the word "free",
in english, is ambiguous-

330
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:32,504
-it has a number
of different meanings.

331
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:37,505
One of them means "zero price",
but another meaning is "freedom".

332
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,500
So think of "free speech",
not "free beer".

333
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,500
There's a similarity between
the folk process where a poem-

334
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:58,505
-or a song or a story
can get refined and reshaped-

335
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,500
-by one teller or singer
after another-

336
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:08,505
-and the way
free software gets improved.

337
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:18,500
You'll often find cases where a free
program is being developed now by-

338
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:22,505
-a group of people who
include none of the original developers.

339
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,500
In 1991 we had almost finished
the GNU system.

340
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:35,505
Our goal was to make an OS, like
UNIX, but entirely free software.

341
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
This complete operating system
required many different components-

342
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:45,505
By 1991 we had
almost all of those components.

343
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Many of them we had written,
and many others we had found-

344
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:54,501
-somebody else had written it for
his own purposes but it did the job.

345
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:57,505
And so we pressed it
into service as a part of GNU.

346
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
One major component was still missing:
the component called the "kernel".

347
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:07,505
So it was very useful
that Linus Torvalds wrote a kernel.

348
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,500
At that point, combining his kernel,
Linux, with the larger GNU system-

349
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:18,505
-produced a complete
runnable system that-

350
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:21,506
-you could actually
put onto your PC and run.

351
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:29,500
So once Linux was developed
the GNU system in effect was completed!

352
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:34,505
It began to catch on in
popularity, but at the same time-

353
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:38,506
-an unfortunate thing happened.
The people who were using-

354
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
-the GNU system didn't
realize it was the GNU system.

355
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:48,505
So they began calling the
whole combination "Linux"-

356
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
-and that confusion spread.

357
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:55,505
As a result, it's very hard
for us in the GNU project-

358
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,500
-to call the user's attention
to the ethical and political issues.

359
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:05,505
Hoarders can
get piles of money

360
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,500
That is true, hackers,
that is true

361
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:16,505
But they cannot
help their neighbor

362
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,500
That's not good, hackers,
that's not good

363
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:27,505
Most computer science in the USA comes
traditionally from military background-

364
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,506
-and defense spending.

365
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,500
Perhaps it isn't any more quirky that
nowadays the "free software" movement-

366
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:40,505
-finds room both for
Richard Stallman and libertarian ideals.

367
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Many saw free software also
as a new way of making money-

368
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,501
-and needed a less radical concept.

369
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,505
Enter: open source.

370
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
"I want you to be an
open source developer"

371
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
We looked at the history
of advocacy in what at the time was-

372
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,501
-still mostly called the "free software"
movement and we concluded-

373
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,509
-that it hadn't worked!

374
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,500
That in fact the rhetoric and the tactics
used by Richard Stallman and the-

375
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:15,505
-Free Software Foundation had left us
worse off than we were when we started.

376
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
The term "open source" doesn't
really imply the political issues-

377
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:26,505
-like it used to and the
"free software" term still does.

378
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
There's now a second movement,
the "open source" movement-

379
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:34,505
-where they consider
only the practical benefits.

380
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,500
They refuse, and I mean
that literally... they carefully avoid-

381
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:46,505
-the issues of principle, freedom, ethics
and making a good society to live in.

382
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,500
That kind of language is
implicitly threatening to people-

383
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:57,505
-whose day-to-day concerns are: "how
do I increase my shareholder value?",-

384
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,506
-"how do I keep
control over my business?"

385
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,500
How do I address my
actual down-to-earth problems?

386
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,510
When you walk into their offices and say
"you should use all open source for your-

387
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:15,505
-business because sharing is good
and hoarding is evil" - it doesn't work!

388
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,500
I am not against business.
I don't believe in abolishing business.

389
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:26,509
I do business myself. But I believe
business should not dominate all of life.

390
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,500
The rules of society should not
be chosen primarily to please business.

391
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:38,505
Early in 1998 the majority usage in
the community went from "free software"-

392
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,500
-to "open source" in six weeks flat.
In the late spring or early summer of 1998.

393
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:50,505
That told me that there had been huge
pent-up demand in the community-

394
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:54,505
-for a way of explaining what we
were doing that was more effective.

395
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
The whole attitude in the
trade press and the investor community-

396
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,501
-completely turned around!

397
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:08,505
The same people who had spent years
sneering dismissively at "free software"-

398
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,500
-and talking about
sandal-wearing freaks with long hair...

399
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:19,505
Those very same people within a year
were falling all over themselves to write-

400
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,500
-laudatory articles about the wonders
of open source and peer review.

401
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:26,505
-and this is really funny
because it was the same software-

402
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:29,506
-and in most
cases the same people!

403
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
"Robin Hood of the nerds"

404
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,505
"Martin Luther, meet Linus Torvalds"

405
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Linux happened without
the help of people with deep pockets-

406
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,501
-or even despite the help.

407
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:51,505
How can we keep from destroying the
magic by pouring all this money into Linux?

408
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
When Linux started
to become commercialized-

409
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:59,505
-people said: "oh well, we'd like to
keep it as our own little project".

410
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
"Nobody should be
making any money off it".

411
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:08,505
Well, in the real world people make
money off things. The US is a capitalistic-

412
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:11,506
-society and
Europe is a capitalistic society.

413
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:16,509
In order for
companies to start using Linux-

414
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,505
-they wanna have somebody sitting
there, who can give them support,-

415
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
-who can sell them the hardware.

416
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:31,501
And these people who sell this hardware
and support are going to make money.

417
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Not everyone
of us is a hacker.

418
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:43,505
Actually, very few of us would take the
effort to download Linux from the net.

419
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Even fewer will tackle with the
code itself in order to improve it.

420
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:53,505
Though, Linux was
hard to use, customers valued strongly-

421
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:57,506
-its reliability
and open source code.

422
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,500
There was an opportunity
for companies with new visions.

423
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
"Red Hat"

424
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
For Red Hat, it wasn't
important that we ship a better-

425
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,501
-operating system than
Microsoft's or Sun Microsystems'-

426
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:22,505
It becomes really important
that we ship an operating system-

427
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:25,506
-that solves a problem for our
customers that they cannot solve-

428
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:29,507
-using the traditional
proprietary "binary only" software.

429
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:33,505
We were recognizing
what we were doing was we were-

430
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,509
-building technology
and then giving it away!

431
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
So we said: "Well, how do
you make money doing this?"

432
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:43,505
Of course, we would go to California,
to Silicon Valley, and everyone said:

433
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:46,506
"Well, you cannot make
money in the software business-

434
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,514
-by giving your technology away".

435
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:53,505
We would come back and talk to our
customers and we realized the only thing-

436
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:57,509
-that kept our customers loyal
was that we did give away our technology.

437
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,500
For the very first time they had control
over the technology they're using.

438
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:07,501
The real value in most software products
is the active maintainence down the line-

439
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,502
-the continuing support
relationship between the vendor and you.

440
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
That's what gives software
fundamentally the characteristics of-

441
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:17,505
-the service industry rather
than the manufacturing industry.

442
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:23,510
Linux is flourishing in the
Internet server appliance area.

443
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:29,505
But because there has not been an
easy-to-use software for home users-

444
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
-it has only a small
margin of the desktop market.

445
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:41,505
The GNOME project, with its
graphical interface tries to fill that gap.

446
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:48,510
But hacker elitism
still seems to follow Linux.

447
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Do you see who's here?
It's a penguin!

448
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,515
-It's Tux, actually...
-Hi, Tux!

449
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,500
When Linus Torvalds makes
millionaires and billionaires-

450
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:08,510
Bill Gates' hair turns grey...

451
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Microsoft has a very traditional model:

452
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:16,510
They make closed source code,
they put it on a CD, they sell that.

453
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:20,505
They take on all the
burden of development themselves.

454
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:21,515
Everything goes back through them.

455
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Once you're in that business
it's very hard to change your culture.

456
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:32,505
It's very hard to change your business
to one where you cooperate.

457
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,500
It's easier to make money
off closed source products-

458
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:43,505
-if you don't need, or
you have the huge market share.

459
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
So, for example, Microsoft
does not have a huge incentive-

460
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:49,510
-to open source
their code right now.

461
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:53,505
And it would probably cut
into their profits, so I don't think-

462
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:54,515
-they're gonna do it,
or at least not willingly.

463
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,500
There's algorithms that you
may in fact want to keep proprietary.

464
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:04,505
For example, I know of certain
compression algorithms that companies-

465
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:06,515
-have put a lot of work into.
For things like streaming media.

466
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
And they don't want people
to know how they do that -

467
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,510
-because it's exactly how they
do that that's the value of the product.

468
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Fighting between Linus,
who's the leader of Linux, and-

469
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,510
-Bill Gates who's the leader of Microsoft.

470
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,510
It becomes
really personal.

471
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Next, for our bizarre question:
"Whose lips are these?"

472
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,500
As an answer:
Bill Gates' lips telling another lie...

473
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,500
The acceptance of Linux has
been helped enormously by the fact-

474
00:41:56,505 --> 00:42:01,505
-that people have known that
Linux exists through the news.

475
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,500
The "David versus Goliath" story helped
there, but I don't think it's particularly true.

476
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,500
"Microsoft's Ballmer
claims Linux is communism"

477
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
-You are a socialist...?

478
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
-That's one of the labels
that people put on me.

479
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:21,501
-Is that true?

480
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,500
It's not a secret that I was a
left wing radical in the late 1960's.

481
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Students' UN organization was
behind most demonstrations.

482
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,500
My personal belief system is
more one of personal honour.

483
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:47,505
I don't care what anybody else does...
I want to do what I feel is right.

484
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Linus keeps a very strict
distance to politics.

485
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,500
I think he suffered slightly
in his earliest childhood-

486
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,500
-as his father was so active politically.

487
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
It is also about
having a social conscience-

488
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:15,505
-and if you call that socialism
then, yeah, I guess I'm socialist...

489
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:24,500
He is radical within a very restricted
area, where he sets the limits himself.

490
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:31,505
He is very reluctant
to take part in fuzzy political discourse-

491
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
-and there's the difference
between the pragmatist-

492
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:41,505
-who wants to work with concrete
stuff and not let the steam-

493
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:49,500
-go out through his ears,
like we used to do in the 1960's.

494
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,500
This is a community. You can take
but you must give back!

495
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:59,505
-من بسیار خوشبختم ازینکه امروز اعلام کنم

496
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:02,511
-برنده امسال جایزه IDG لینوس توروالدز : دبیان است

497
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,500
-این بسیار خوبه که لینوکس به سمت چیزهای جدید نظر مثبتی نشون میده
498
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,501
-شامل جنبه های تجاری می‌شود.

499
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:19,502
-سلام، من از برزیل اومدم و بسیار مشتاقم بدونم چه کارهایی میتونیم انجام بدیم

500
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:21,503
-برای آوردن شما به برزیل در ماه می سال بعد؟

501
00:44:21,505 --> 00:44:24,505
-آیا شما به مهمانیVA در شب چهارشنبه می‌آیید؟

502
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:26,506
-من به احتمال زیاد خواهم آمد اما در حال حاضر باید بروم...

503
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,500
-من شنیده‌ام که شما به تیراندازی می‌روید؟
-تو با ما می‌آیی رفیق!

504
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,501
-نــــــه...

505
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,503
بسیاری از جوامع نگران این شرکت‌های بزرگ هستند, این فروشندگان تجاری بزرگ

506
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:46,504
-به سمتی نمی‌روند که توانایی برگشت به جامعه را داشته باشند

507
00:44:46,505 --> 00:44:53,505
-این چیزیست که مردم انتظار دارند دیگران به خوبی مراقب همه چیز باشند

508
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:57,506
-و من فکر نمی‌کنم این درست باشه,
-و فکر هم نمی‌کنم که باید درست باشه

509
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:03,515
-و من فکر می‌کنم قدرت لینوکس  پابرجاست حتی اگر کسی به شما کمک نکند

510
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:09,506
-و در هر اینچ (واحد اندازه گیری طول) از مسیر, 
-شما هم‌چنان یک کپی از لینوکس خود را دارید

511
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,514
-و شما هنوز این قدرت را دارید که هرکاری دلتان می‌خواهد انجام دهید

512
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:17,509
من می خواهم از سیاست‌های لینوکس فاصله بگیرم

513
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:25,500
من می‌خواهم همچون کسی باشم که همه اورا بعنوان پسری خوب قبول دارند و او به کسی نیش نمی‌زند (کنایه به اذیت کردن)

514
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
-میشه سوال آخر رو بپرسم؟
-بله حتما!

515
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:32,505
-من اهل هند هستم.

516
00:45:32,506 --> 00:45:34,509
آیا شما کمک‌های زیادی از توسعه‌دهندگان هندی برای توسعه کرنل دریافت کردید؟

517
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
نه خیلی.

518
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:39,509
شما چه پیامی برای آن‌ها دارید تا که شاید کمک‌های بیشتری از آن‌ها دریافت کنید؟

519
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
من فکر می‌کنم این یک مشکل زیرساختی‌ است.

520
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:47,502
آن‌ها لزوما به اینترنت دسترسی ندارند یا سرعت اینترنتشان بسیار ضعیف است.

521
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:52,515
من فکر می‌کنم مردمشان برای انجام همکاری از اینترنت استفاده نمی‌کنند.

522
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:55,510
آن‌ها به گونه‌های مختلفی عصبی هستند، درسته؟

523
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:59,506
چه پیامی دارید برای آنکه به بیشتر شدن توسعه‌دهندگانشان انگیزه دهید؟

524
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,500
من نمی‌دونم چه مسائلی در هند وجود دارد، اما به سمت مسأله‌دار شدن می‌روند.

525
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:09,501
-مثل این مسأله عمومی که مردم هند می‌خواهند بتوانند هرکاری انجام دهند

526
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:14,502
-که قارهٔ امریکا برای همه اهمیت قائل نمی‌شود.

527
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,500
و من فکر می‌کنم واقعا خیلی انگیزه بخش است وقتی کسی می‌گوید:

528
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:22,505
-"هی، من می‌توانم این مشکل را حل کنم، و لینوکس خودم را توسعه دهم"

529
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
-"و این برای من بعنوان یک هندی و یا هرکسی بسیار بهتر خواهد بود".

530
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:33,505
And that's how you should be motivated,
and whatever I say you should not care!

531
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Thank you very much!

532
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:46,505
-You come down to India next time...
-I will try to...

533
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Do you want to take a
picture for a Dutch magazine?

534
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Are you planning on
coming to the Netherlands?

535
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,500
The real value of Linux may be some-
where else than knocking Microsoft out.

536
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Linux was designed to run on a cheap
hardware and to solve common problems.

537
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,505
If you are poor it is a
real alternative, free of charge.

538
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,500
The Linux project started
in Europe and the United States.

539
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:28,505
But now, free software
allows it to find ever more-

540
00:47:28,506 --> 00:47:30,510
-new programmers
from new sources-

541
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,500
-from regions where
computing is still in its infancy.

542
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Beijing, China

543
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,500
China is behind the developed
countries in the IT industry.

544
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:54,505
The gap is big and
we try to catch up as fast we can.

545
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,515
During this we have to borrow
from other countries' experiences.

546
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,500
We put a great importance
on the operating system.

547
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:06,505
We did some
development work based on UNIX-

548
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Due to tight market control
we were not able to succeed.

549
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:13,505
Linux provides us
with a very good opportunity

550
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:17,515
-and a base to learn
from advanced technology.

551
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,500
"The Chinese Red Army
delighted with Linux"

552
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,500
I think that this is the greatest
transfer of wealth we may have ever seen-

553
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:37,501
-between the industrialized
rich north, and put Europe and-

554
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:42,502
-the United States together
in that, and the third world!

555
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,500
It's the open source.

556
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:10,505
I think this is
important to many people.

557
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,500
I like philosophy, and I like to analyze
matters from a philosophic perspective.

558
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:20,505
The open source is in
accordance with the spirit of science-

559
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,500
-the free and unrestricted
access to information.

560
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:27,505
Nothing should be hidden.
That's my first impression of Linux.

561
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,500
The spirit could be
expanded to other fields.

562
00:49:38,505 --> 00:49:44,505
I never feel that this
only applies in the computer field.

563
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:52,500
You have one of the most privileged
classes in capitalism: programmers!

564
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:55,501
They can make so much
money from working as programmers-

565
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:58,504
-that they have the time
to devote to their own hobbies.

566
00:49:58,505 --> 00:50:01,510
Programmers like Alan Cox,
they could name their price!

567
00:50:02,505 --> 00:50:05,505
Here are these people who
are at the top of the heap, and through-

568
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:09,506
-the structure of transfer of intellectual
property they've come up with,-

569
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,507
-they're transferring that wealth.

570
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:15,508
It is socialism in action,
even if the libertarians-

571
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:20,509
-are horrified
whenever that is mentioned.

572
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Open source projects have been
compared to the way science is created.

573
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,505
Science in itself
doesn't make money-

574
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,500
The wealth comes as
the result of applications.

575
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,500
For the open source
hackers developing Linux-

576
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:58,510
-has traditionally been a science-
like voluntary project. A hobby.

577
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,505
Eventually, the best
Linux hackers were enlisted.

578
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:12,505
In 1999, during the dot-com boom,
some of the Linux companies went public.

579
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,505
Wall Street announced record-
breaking value for Linux stock.

580
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Of course it didn't last,
but for a period of time-

581
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:26,505
-some Linux hackers
were filthy rich - on paper.

582
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,500
Just about everyone who
was a core developer before-

583
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,501
-all this whoopla about people
making money doing Linux-

584
00:51:35,502 --> 00:51:39,505
-have kept to their
values in taking these jobs.

585
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,500
Most of the ones I keep in contact with,
have a very crucial position and are-

586
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,504
-pretty much doing all of the Linux work
they were doing before they had the job-

587
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:53,505
-with the same levels of freedom, as well.
I still got changes from people every day-

588
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:00,500
-I still submitted them to Linus, the
same way I always did before the IPO.

589
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Some of us are driving nicer cars than
beforehand. That's the only difference.

590
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,501
Maybe we're eating
a little bit more sushi.

591
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,504
There are some people who got lucky,
joined the right company at the right time.

592
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:20,505
Managed to participate in the IPO
lottery and there are some people who-

593
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,500
-got millions of dollars, and there are
some people who got billions of dollars!

594
00:52:25,501 --> 00:52:30,501
Did those people actually contribute more
to the company than those other people?

595
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:33,502
In some cases they just
happened to contribute the right-

596
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:35,503
-amount of investment
money at the right time.

597
00:52:35,504 --> 00:52:39,505
I think that's a generic problem that's
not unique to the open source community.

598
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,500
I don't know if we actually
have a good solution for that.

599
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Part of what I like about
Silicon Valley is just that it's so dynamic,-

600
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,501
-and you can do anything here.

601
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:58,502
And even the money-grabbing
approach. Even if it's slightly tasteless-

602
00:52:58,503 --> 00:53:02,510
-especially when you come from Europe,
it's a really good motivational factor.

603
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:07,505
It's a really good way
of getting things done.

604
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,500
Has it changed me?
I assume so.

605
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:16,505
I'm not the same
person I was when I moved-

606
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:23,500
-but I don't think it's made me all that
more money-conscious than I used to be.

607
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,500
2001 - Imagined by Stanley Kubrick.

608
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:38,505
In the most ambitious and
grotesque PR stunt in history-

609
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:44,500
-suicide hijackers blitz America
with far-reaching consequences.

610
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:48,505
IT recession
affects also open source.

611
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,500
No longer does Linus have to act
in public all the time as an enlightened-

612
00:53:54,501 --> 00:54:00,505
-philosopher ruler, harassed by the media.
With the coolness of Linux still intact-

613
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
-the phenomenon
disappears into gadgets.

614
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:09,509
Invisible pieces of technology for
households and entertainment industry.

615
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Gradually, many of us turn into
Linux users when the code infiltrates-

616
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:20,505
-our clocks, toasters
and mobile phones.

617
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:27,500
As for bigger ideals, it could be one of the
greatest missed opportunities of our times-

618
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:33,505
-if free software
liberated nothing but code.

619
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,500
There's no question that
development of technology-

620
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:50,501
-is just going to make
Linux obsolete at some point.

621
00:54:50,502 --> 00:54:54,505
The question is just:
"How long will it take?"

622
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,500
Will it be in 5 years, or
15 years or will it be 50 years?

623
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:11,505
I think one of the powers of
open source is that in 50 years-

624
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,500
-the next operating system
that's the best at the time-

625
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:22,505
-will be able to take advantage
of the source base that Linux had.

626
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,500
The source code itself is
going to be the memory of Linux-

627
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:31,509
